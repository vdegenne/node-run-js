# node-run-js

## How to use

Associate `node-run-js.exe` to `.js` extension on Windows. Now you can double clicking a script to run its content.
Normally you would open a terminal and type `node <filename>` to run a script but this hack lets you run scripts by clicking them.
It is particularly useful when you don't need to read the output and your script is just used to run a deamon or make some filesystem manipulation.
